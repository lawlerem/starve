\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{sf} object of point geometries}

\item{settings}{An object of class \code{staRVe_settings}}

\item{silent}{Should intermediate calculations be shown?}

\item{y}{An \code{sf} object of point geometries containing possible parents}

\item{time}{The time index for each location in x}

\item{check_intersection}{Logical. If true, duplicated locations will be checked}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{dag}
}
\description{
A directed acyclic graph is stored as an ordered list. The ith element of the
  list is a vector containing indices j such that there is a directed edge
  from node j to node i, or possibly node (i+k-1) as detailed below.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{construct_dag}: Construct a directed acyclic graph from a single
\code{sf} object. The first element of the ordered list contains the indices
for the first k rows, where k is the n_neighbours settings. The ith element
contains the parents for the (i+k-1)th row of x. Also returns a sorted copy
of the locations x.

\item \code{construct_obs_dag}: Construct a directed acyclic graph from one \code{sf}
object to another. The i'th element of the list is a vector containing
indices j such that there is a directed edge from node j (in y) to node i (in x).
