--- Multiple Independent Variables ---

** C++ side **
1.) Multivariate random effects
  a.) Pass in array of random effects instead of vector
    -- x[i][j][k]: k gives year, j gives location, i gives variable
  b.) nngp object
    -- w and mean add columns for each variable
    -- share ws_graph and ws_dists between variables
    -- ws_joints and ws_krigs are vector<vector<MVNORM_t<Type> > > instead of vector<MVNORM_t<Type> >, outermost vector indexes variable

2.) Multivariate observations
  a1.) Pass in data as long format -- one vector for response values, one vector for variable index; or,
  a2.) pass in data in wide format, one observation object for each variable, store all in a vector <---
  b.) Pass in missing values as NA, just skip over them in likelihood evaluation (integrate them out?)



--- Independent --> Dependent Variables ---

** R side **
1.) Add quantiles to random effects
2.) Add copula families to get_staRVe_distributions
  a.) Check for only two response for bivariate families
3.) Add copula parameters to staRVe_process_parameters

** C++ side **
1.) Compute quantiles for random effects & report them
2.) Add copula header file (similar to family.hpp)
3.) Add likelihood contribution for copula for each row of random effects
